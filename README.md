# Car Parking System
A Verilogâ€‘based car parking system was created using ultrasonic sensors to detect vehicle presence in each
parking spot.
The occupancy status of each spot was displayed on a PmodOLED display, providing an accurate and reliable
method for managing parking spaces.

The above is the basic idea what and how this project proceeds. More informations are available in this repository.
